## About Base Layers

**Base Layers** provides utility classes and Sass mixins (SCSS) to help you build out your site.

**Base Layers** is geared towards front-end developers that want a little something to help with commonly-repeated styles but that don't want an existing theme or design as opinionated as Bootstrap or Material UI.

First, it strips away all your styles (using [Eric Meyer's CSS reset](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/)). Next, it gives you some basics to help get you ready for your day of web development. The rest is up to you!

It's like the tank top that you wear under your hoodie. It isn't the main outfit.

No blouses, no ties, and **definitely no fedoras**. It isn't your website's outfit, it's your website's base layers.
